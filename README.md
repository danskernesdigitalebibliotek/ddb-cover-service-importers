# DDB Cover Service Importers

This is the indexer and cover importer for DDB Cover Service.

## Architecture Overview

The DDB COver Service application consists of multiple logical parts with individual repositories:

This repository:

* An CLI based image import/index/upload engine that handles import, indexing
  and uploading of cover images from external providers.

Other repositories:

* [A web facing REST API powered by the ElasticSearch index](https://github.com/danskernesdigitalebibliotek/ddb-cover-service)
* [Statistics export to the Faktor Service](https://github.com/danskernesdigitalebibliotek/ddb-cover-service-faktor-export)
* [Upload Service for DDB CMS](https://github.com/danskernesdigitalebibliotek/ddb-cover-service-upload)

## Tech Stack

This is a Symfony 5 (flex) project.

Server/hosting reference requirements: PHP 7.4, Nginx 1.14, MariaDB 10.3,
ElasticSearch 6.8, Redis Server 6, RabbitMQ 3.9.

The application is currently developed and hosted on this stack. However, the
individual components can be swapped for relevant alternatives. Apache can be
used instead of Nginx. Any database supported by Doctrine DBAL such as MySQL or
PostgreSQL can replace MariaDB. Redis is used as caching layer for Symfony.
Both support multiple other persistence layers such as memcache and RabbitMQ,
respectively, and can be changed as needed.

Application components:

* [Symfony 5 (flex)](https://symfony.com/) - underlying Web Application
  framework
* [Doctrine 2](https://www.doctrine-project.org/) - database DBAL/ORM layer
* [RabbitMq](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) - RabbitMQ is used for async jobs

External Services:

* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is used as CDN and transformation engine
  for all cover images
* [Open Search](https://www.dbc.dk/produkter-services/webservices/open-search)
  is used for mapping between common ids (isbn etc.) and library specific id's
  such as 'pid' and 'faust'

### Messaging

For performance reasons both parts are designed around a messaging-based architecture to allow for asynchronous handling
of tasks. For the API this means that any task not strictly needed for the response such as various logging tasks are
deferred and handled after the request/response. For the import engine only the initial read from source is done
synchronously. For each imported cover image individual index and upload jobs are created and run later.

### Services and Dependency Injection

All internal functionality is defined as individual services. These are autowired through dependency injection
by [Symfony's Service Container](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html)

### Persistence

The import engine defines a number of entities for storing relevant data on imports and images. These are mapped to and
persisted in the database through doctrine. Further a 'search' entity is defined with the fields exposed by the REST
API. This entity is mapped one-to-one to an index in ElasticSearch.

### Logging and Statistics

The application logs to ElasticSearch to allow debugging and monitoring. A `stats_dd-mm-yyyy` is created daily. To
ensure that Elastic chooses the right type for the index fields a dynamic index template must be added to Elastic. This
can be done with the `app:elastic:create-stats-template` command.

## Implementation Overview

### Import/Index/Upload Engine

The overall flow of the consist of import -> upload -> index:

1. For each Vendor the full list of available materials is read. Each found material is saved as `Source` and
   a `ProcessMessage` is generated with `VendorImageTopic` and `id => image URL`
2. Each image URL is validated and it's verified that the remote image exists. If the image is found
   the `ProcessMessage` is forwarded with a `CoverStoreTopic` and `Source` is updated with relevant metadata.
3. Each image is added to Cloudinary through their API. This enables us to just instruct Cloudinary to fetch the image
   from the image URL and add to the Media Library. An `Image` is created containing Cloudinary metadata and
   an `ProcessMessage` with `SearchTopic`is sent.
4. A search is made in Open Search to determine what id 'aliases' the image should be indexed under. We know the ISxx
   from the Vendor but to build index entries for PID and FAUST we need to match these through Open Search. For each id
   a new `Search` entry is made which is automatically synced to ElasticSearch.

#### Vendors

The application needs to import covers from a number of different vendors through their exposed access protocols. This
means we need to support various
strategies such as crawling zip-archives via ftp, parsing excel files and accessing APIs. Individual `VendorServices`
are defined for each vendor to
support their respective data access. These all extend `AbstractBaseVendorService` were common functionality needed by
the importers is
defined.

All vendor implementations are located under `/src/Service/VendorService/*`

#### Services

The application defines a number of internal services for the various tasks. These are autowired through dependency
injection by [Symfony's Service
Container](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html)

##### CoverStore

Abstracts [Cloudinarys Upload API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference) functionality into a
set of helper methods for upload, delete and
generate. "Generate" will create a generic cover based on a default image.

##### OpenPlatform

Implements authentication and search
against [Open Search](https://www.dbc.dk/produkter-services/webservices/open-search)

##### Vendor Services

Common functionality for all Vendor importers is shared in `AbstractBaseVendorService`. Individual importers are defined
for each vendor to
contain the import logic for the vendors specific access setup (FTP/Spreadsheet/API etc).

## Development Setup

### Docker compose

The project comes with a docker-compose setup base on development only images, that comes with all required extensions
to PHP (including xdebug) and all services
required to run the application.

For easy usage it's recommended to use tr√¶fik (proxy) and the wrapper script for docker-compose used at
ITKDev (<https://github.com/aakb/itkdev-docker/tree/develop/scripts>).
It's not an requirement and the setup examples below is without the script. The script just makes working with docker
simpler and faster.

#### Running docker setup

Start the stack.

```shell
docker-compose up --detach
```

All the symfony commands below to install the application can be executed using this pattern.

```shell
docker-compose exec phpfpm bin/console <CMD>
```

### Install

We assume you have a working local/vagrant/docker web server setup with PHP,
Nginx, MariaDB, ElasticSearch and Redis.

1. Checkout the project code from GitHub and run `composer install` from the
   project root dir
2. Create a `/.env.local` file and define the relevant environment variables to
   match your setup
3. Run migrations `bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`
4. Create ES search index `bin/console fos:elastica:create`
5. Run `vendor/bin/phpunit` to ensure your test suite is working.
6. Run `bin/console app:vendor:populate` to populate the vendor tables with the implemented vendors.
7. Add relevant access config to the vendor table

Application can now load vendors through the `bin/console app:vendor:load` command.
The application is purely a job queue and command based. No API or site is exposed
through http(s).

## Development

### Doctrine Migrations

The project uses [Doctrine
Migrations](https://symfony.com/doc/master/bundles/DoctrineMigrationsBundle/index.html)
to handle updates to the database schema. Any changes to the schema should have
a matching migration. If you make changes to the entity model you should run
`bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff` to generate a migration with the
necessary `sql` statements. Review the migration before executing it with
`bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`

After changes to the entity model and migrations always run `bin/console
doctrine:schema:validate` to ensure that mapping is correct and database schema
is in sync with the current mapping file(s).

### Commands

To simplify testing during development test console commands are defined for the
various services defined in the application. These are described for each
service in the "Services" section of this document. Using these commands you can
manually test each service in isolation without having to run one or more
message queues.

#### OpenPlatform Authentication

Simple command to test that the authentication service is working and has the
correct configuration in the environment.

```sh
bin/console app:openplatform:auth
```

#### OpenPlatform Search

This command runs a search into the open platform datawell. The last parameter
if set will by-pass the cache. The command will output the search result.

```sh
bin/console app:openplatform:search --type=isbn --identifier=9788702173277
```

#### Cover Store

This command will upload an image into the cover store.

```sh
bin/console app:cover:upload <IMAGE URL> <FOLDER> <TAG(s)>
```

#### Vendor commands

This runs the importer for the configured vendors. The command will prompt for
which vendors to import.

```sh
bin/console app:vendor:load
```

Please note:
To ensure that the command run with a "flat" memory foot print in production
you must run it with `--no-debug` in the `prod` environment.

Production

```sh
bin/console app:vendor:load --env=prod --no-debug
```

Note: For some Vendors proper access credentials need to be set in the database
before running an import. To populate the `Vendor` table you can run:

```sh
bin/console app:vendor:populate
```

This will create an entry for each defined vendor service that extends
`AbstractBaseVendorService`. However, you must manually add the relevant
credentials to each row in the database.

#### Vendor event

This command will fire an insert event an place an job into the message queue
system that will import an image into Cover Store and update the search index.

```sh
bin/console app:vendor:event insert 9788702173277 ISBN 1
```

### Message queues

The application defines a number of job queues for the various background tasks
and is configured to use Redis as the persistence layer for queues/messages. To
have a fully functioning development setup you will need to run consumers for
all queues. See the [Symfony docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html) for more information
about the Messenger Component.

To run consumers for all queues do

```shell
bin/console messenger:consume --env=prod --quiet --time-limit=900 --failure-limit=1 async_priority_high
bin/console messenger:consume --env=prod --quiet --time-limit=900 --failure-limit=1 async_priority_normal
bin/console messenger:consume --env=prod --quiet --time-limit=900 --failure-limit=1 async_priority_low
bin/console messenger:consume --env=prod --quiet --time-limit=900 --failure-limit=1 async_no_hit
```

Or use all your works to run all queue in the order given (from high to no-hit).

```shell
bin/console messenger:consume --env=prod --quiet --time-limit=900 --failure-limit=1 async_priority_high \
async_priority_normal async_priority_low async_no_hit
```

#### Message Queues and Doctrine

If Doctrine throws an exception when interacting with the database the Consumers' Entity Manager will close and not
re-open. This will cause subsequent message handling to fail. To handle this run the consumers with `--failure-limit=1`.
This will cause the consumer to exit if an exception is thrown. The Consumer will then be restarted with a new Entity
Manager assuming Supervisor or similar is used to run the consumers.

See: Symfony PR [#35453](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/35453)

### Testing

The application has a test suite consisting of unit tests.

To run the unit tests located in `/tests` you can run:

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
docker compose exec phpfpm ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Both bugfixes and added features should be supported by matching tests.

### Psalm static analysis

We are using [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) for static analysis. To run
psalm do

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
docker compose exec phpfpm ./vendor/bin/psalm
```

### Check Coding Standard

The following command let you test that the code follows
the coding standard for the project.

* PHP files (PHP-CS-Fixer)

    ```shell
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer check-coding-standards
    ```

* Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)

    ```shell
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:14 install
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:14 check-coding-standards
    ```

### Apply Coding Standards

To attempt to automatically fix coding style

* PHP files (PHP-CS-Fixer)

    ```sh
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer apply-coding-standards
    ```

* Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)

    ```shell
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:14 install
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:14 apply-coding-standards
    ```

## CI

Github Actions are used to run the test suite and code style checks on all PR's.

If you wish to test against the jobs locally you can install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
Then do:

```sh
act -P ubuntu-latest=shivammathur/node:latest pull_request
```
